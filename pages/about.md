# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I was born in 2002.

My interest in programming began around 2018. when I came across the source code of wLaunchELF. a homebrew filebrowser for the PS2.  
Unfortunately school kept me quite busy, So I started programming approximately on August 2020. when free time was abundant due to COVID.  
I started playing around with C++ on windows. only knowing how logic gates worked (thanks to school).  
after a few months, and with the help of Alex Parrado (a fellow developer) I installed the PS2SDK and started coding for PS2.  
At first it was quite overwhelming. but with time i've learnt quite a lot of both the PS2 and the C language.
