- title: DONGLEMAN is not unique
  date: 13/2/2025
  description: After doing some checks, I realized dongleman module used by SC2 is not unique, actually, scanning a package of several dongle Dumps yielded more than 60 matches with the same hash arised (<code>0a6ca23ae87aba1d0a12641435f84327</code>)
- title: I got a Conquest Card!!!!

  description: today I got my hands on a conquest card. thanks so much to @kuze from www.arcade-projects.com/ for this amazing donation. this will allow me to continue with more invasive tests. like manipulating the game dongle to inject software to track down all sent commands to the card and log them into the console UART
- title: Arcade Magicgate on SCPH-10020
  date: 14/5/2025
  description: I used to believe that arcade PS2s were authenticating cards on slot2 with retail magicgate... I was Wrong.
               SCPH-10020 official cards support several keys (Developer, Retail, Arcade and another unknown set of keys)
               if the cryptography is done by the memory card chip and not the game software, this discovery will prove to be very useful.
               not to mention that it will be needed for handling conquest cards outside of an arcade PS2 (Be it retail PS2 or the PS3 CECHZM1)

  description: sorry for the delay. I've been waiting all this time for a JVS adapter board (those MP007-IONA-US things) from aliexpress, took like 2 months shipping...
               Well, I'm back on track. so you may see more entries here from time to time.

- title: unpacking the game code
  date: 27/8/2025
  description: with some help, now PS2AC05 (the main game code binary blob) can be decrypted and unpacked. a tool to do this will be released eventually
- title: a decoy!
  date: 28/8/2025
  description: the DONGLEMAN driver inside IOPRPACM was a decoy at the end, the conquest card access is done with customized versions of SIO2MAN, MCSERV and DONGLEMAN embedded on the game 
               there is still a lot to do, specially considering those CPUDAT files also seem to be more code blobs...
